# Cloudflare Pages
Welcome to Lab 1 at Cloudflare Connect 2022 - This lab will focus on setting up a simple image gallery deployed on Cloudflare Edge using Cloudflare Pages.
By the end of this lab you will have:

- Set up your first Pages project
- Felt the developer experience when using Pages
- Added dynamic functionality with with help from Cloudflare Workers/Functions

Build fast sites.In record time. Cloudflare Pages is a JAMstack platform for frontend developers to collaborate and deploy websites.

## Clone GitHub Repository
To make things easier we have setup a starter gallery app on GitHub. Lets fork and clone the repository.

``` sh
gh repo fork cf-tme/connect_2022_lab1
```
This should create a fork of the starter repository in your gh account. Follow the fork with a clone

``` sh
gh repo clone <yourgithubusername>/connect_2022_lab1
```

Now all the files should be local in your working directory, let navigate into the repo and start coding! 

``` sh
cd <yourgithubusername>/connect_2022_lab1
```

## Deploy Pages Project from GitHub Repository
Deploying our GitHub project to pages is as simple as connecting our GitHub account to Cloudflare.

Login to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)

Select **Pages** on the left hand side and press **Create a Project** and select **Connect GitHub**

![pages](./screencaps/pages_gh_setup.png)

```{admonition} Authenticate to GitHub
:class: note
If you are not already logged into GitHub in your browser you may be asked to re-authenticate
```
You will be prompted to **Install and Authorize** Cloudflare Pages to your github account, press the button to proceed.

![linkgh](./screencaps/pages_gh_auth.png)

Once connected you will be brought back to the Cloudflare Pages dashboard. Select *connect_2022_lab1* on the following page 

![linkgh](./screencaps/pages_gh_repo_select.png)

Once selected you will need to configure build parameters. This is build using React so we will set the following build parameters:

```
Project name - connect-2022-lab1
Production branch - master
Framework preset - Create React App
Build command - npm run build
Build output directory - /build
```

![linkgh](./screencaps/pages_gh_add.png)


Press **Deploy**

```{admonition} Deployment Progress
:class: note
Once started the deployment will take a few moments to complete - you can follow the deployment details to monitor progress of the deployment.
```
Once the deployment has completed you will be presented with a success message as well as a URL to visit your new project Select the **link**.
```{admonition} pages.dev Domain
:class: note
By default new projects will automatically be given a *.pages.dev domain, If you would like to setup custom routes to your own domain you can do that through DNS CNAMEing (or directly in the project settings if your domain nameservers are Cloudflare)
```
When navigating to the link you should see a blurry image gallery.

![linkgh](./screencaps/blurry-img-gallery.png)

Terrific! Congratulations you have successfully deployed a custom application using Cloudflare Pages.

## Using Functions with Cloudflare Pages

Functions enable you to run server-side code to enable dynamic functionality without running a dedicated server. With Functions, you can introduce application aspects such as authenticating, querying databases, handling form submissions, or working with middleware.

```{admonition} Learn More about Functions! 
:class: note
Check out the [Cloudflare Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/) to learn more
```
For our simple gallery application we are going to create a new function that will simply return the time when navigating to the *time* page for our application.

Returning to our command line lets change to the *functions* directory

``` sh
cd functions
```

Whatever name we give this file is going to be the path in our url. Lets create a new file called *time.js*

``` sh
touch time.js
```
Now open that file in your favorite text editor.

```{admonition} Text Editor
:class: note
VS Code is a versatile text editor that can be launched directly from the terminal using *code <filename>* to install VS Code follow the steps found in the [Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
```
In the file enter the following code:

```js
export const onRequest = () => {
  return new Response(new Date().toISOString())
}
```
This is a fairly simple piece of code but it should just return the string with the current Date and Time in ISO format.

Save the file and return to our terminal window.

In order to push these changes to our project we simply just need to commit and push them to our repository and Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild the application.

To commit and push changes we use standard git commands:

``` sh
gid add .
git commit -m "added new time function"
git push
```

```{admonition} Paged Auto-Build
:class: note
By default Cloudflare Pages will rebuild and deploy your application with every push to the github repository, if this is undesirable auto-deployments can be temporarily turned off
```
If we return to the the Cloudflare Pages project we should see that the deployment is in progress - wait for it to complete.

![linkgh](./screencaps/pages-deploy.png)

Once complete we can renavigate to our application URL but this time going to the */time* pages. We should see a very simple readout of the current date and time. 

```

```

```{admonition} Building APIs
:class: Note
Functions are great ways to build integrations into other APIs, or even build API endpoints for the web application itself
```

## Creating and Binding KV store
Workers KV is Cloudflareâ€™s globally replicated key-value storage solution. Binding these KV namespaces with your application are what make it truly full-stack - the ability to read and write data dynamically right from Cloudflare's edge.

### Creating an IMAGES KV Namespace
Our application has been written to read data from env.IMAGES - this means we need to bind our KV namespace to our project with the variable name "IMAGES"

From your Cloudflare account landing page navigate to **Workers > KV** 

```{admonition} Verify Email
:class: Note
If you have not already confirmed your e-mail address for your Cloudflare Account you may be asked to Verify it here before creating any KV namespaces
```

Select **Create Namespace** and enter *IMAGES* in the *Namespace Name* and press **Add**

![kv-name](./screencaps/kv-namespace.png)

```{admonition} Namespace ID
:class: Note
Once  your namespace is created you will be given a Namespace ID - this will be needed later on in Lab 2, so if you plan on joining us for Lab 2 go ahead and take note of this id - you can always navigate back to this screen and grab it later if needed.
```

### Binding KV Namespace to Pages Project ###

Once our Namespace is created we must bind it to our Pages project so that our functions can leverage the data inside.

```{admonition} Look Ahead
:class: Note
We will be using this namespace in Lab 2 to store Image metadata that will then be read in dynamically update our gallery with images that we upload!
```
From the Left hand side navigation pane on the Cloudflare Dashboard select **Pages** then select our project *connect_2022_lab1* 

In the top navigation bar select **Settings** and then **Functions** On the left hand side.

![kv-name](./screencaps/kv-namespace.png)

Select **Add binding** under the *KV namespace binding* (under *Production* sub-tab)

Enter *IMAGES* in the Variable name and Select the *IMAGES* KV namespace from the dropdown. And press **Save**

![kv-name](./screencaps/save-binding.png)

```{admonition} Manual Re-Deploy
:class: Note
In order for KV binding to take effect we need to rebuild the project - this is generally not an issue when live developing as a git push will force it but in this case to test a few things out we will manual kick off a re-deployment
```
#### Manually Re-Deploy Application ####

To kick off a manual re-deployment we must first select *View build* (in the bottom right) on the latest deployment of our application.

![kv-name](./screencaps/view-build.png)

On the following page select **Manage Deployment** in the top right and press **Retry Deployment**

![kv-name](./screencaps/re-deploy.png)

This will kickoff a manual deployment, give it a few moments to complete.

#### Validate KV Binding with API Call ####

Our web application has been build with an API to query KV store for image metadata and use that data to populate the image Gallery on the homepage. This api endpoint can be found at */api/images*.

```{admonition} Empty KV but Homepage still has images?
:class: Note
The Eagle eyed of you may have noticed that even after Binding our KV we still see images on the Homepage - but how? There is no data in the KV store yet. This is because the values have been hardcoded - for now - in a few moments we will be changing this so that the data is populated dynamically
```

To validate our KV namespace has been bound properly we can quickly just navigate to our API endpoint */api/images* in a Browser and should get back an empty array:

```json
{"images":[]}
```
Congratulations your KV namespace has been successfully bound to your Application functions!


### Fill Gallery images with dynamic data from KV ###

Now that our KV store is ready to use we can change our web application to dynamically fill gallery data with Images whose metadata is stored in the KV store. 
To change this behavior we need to go to edit our definition of the gallery images grid at - */src/components/ImageGrid.tsx* 

Open *ImageGrid.tsx* in your favorite text editor and look at `line:53 - line:119`

``` js
const data = {
    images: [
      {
        id: "8277aeb6-f3fb-445d-43f9-ae710b3ffc00",
        previewURL:
          "https://imagedelivery.net/c_kvDVNdc0jEhXS4gDzgVA/8277aeb6-f3fb-445d-43f9-ae710b3ffc00/blurred",
        name: "hannah-grace-fk4tiMlDFF0-unsplash.jpg",
        alt: "string",
        uploaded: "2021-11-17T06:31:25.203Z",
        isPrivate: true,
      },
      {
        id: "e45bc50e-814f-4f2a-e6ab-d68a3f457500",

        ... cont.
```

Either comment or delete the entire *data* array as we will be replacing it with our simple API call (The "A" in JAM stack) to pull the array of images from the KV store.

Enter the code below in place of the hard-coded image array

``` js
const { data, error } = useSWR<{ images: Image[] }>("/api/images");

  if (error || data === undefined) {
    return (
      <div>
        An unexpected error has occurred when fetching the list of images.
        Please try again.
      </div>
    );

  }
```

To commit and push changes we use standard git commands:

``` sh
gid add .
git commit -m "add dynamic image population functionality"
git push
```

If we return to the the Cloudflare Pages project we should see that the deployment is in progress - wait for it to complete.

Once complete we can navigate to our application URL but this time we should see a blank Gallery Page!

```{admonition} LAB 1 COMPLETE! 
:class: note
You have successfully Completed Lab 1 - Cloudflare Pages, now you have a simple web gallery Application that will read data out from a KV store to dynamically populate images. We hope you can join us for Lab 2, where we will be using Cloudflare Images to upload and optimize images and serve them in our new Gallery!
```
