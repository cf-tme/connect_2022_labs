# Lab 3 - Cloudflare Workers
Welcome to Lab 3 at Cloudflare Connect 2022 - This lab will focus on designing a simple A/B Test for a webpage and writing the test with Workers functions.

By the end of this lab you will have:
- Learnt the basics of A/B testing
- Launched a local test environment using Wrangler

Cloudflare Workers allows you to deploy serverless code instantly across the globe to give it exceptional performance, reliability, and scale.

## Pre-Lab Notes ##

Cloudflare workers is a powerful way to write code in front of your applications directly on Cloudflare's Edge Network. In order to fully realize the benefit of Workers customers are encouraged to have a domain on-boarded to Cloudflare. In these cases it is possible to create custom routes that send requests to a set of workers functions before they are sent to the origin. 

For A/B Testing the logical flow of data is represented by the diagram below

![worker-flow](./screencaps/workersflow.png)

In this flow we are using a workers function to deliver different images to a requestor based on who they are (this can be at random, but more commonly is based on a cookie). Data about what content is served to who is then piped out into an analytics platform.

In this lab - since everyone may not have a custom domain to onboard to cloudflare we will be using the same Workers function and `HTMLRewriter` but we will be running it as a Cloudflare Pages Function to see it in action live.

## Setup Basic Web Application ##

To make things easy we have already built a basic application that can be run on Cloudflare pages. Lets clone the repository and get started.

Move back up to your home directory
``` sh
cd $HOME
```

``` sh
gh repo fork cf-tme/connect_2022_lab3
```
This should create a fork of the starter repository in your gh account and prompt you to clone - enter *Yes*

``` sh
âœ“ Created fork <github-username>/connect_2022_lab3
? Would you like to clone the fork? Yes
```

Now all the files should be local in your working directory, let navigate into the repo to start coding! 

``` sh
cd connect_2022_lab3
```

With the repository cloned lets connect the application to your Cloudflare account and deploy it with pages.

### Deploy project to Pages ###
Deploying our GitHub project to pages is as simple as connecting our GitHub account to Cloudflare.

Login to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)

Select **Pages** on the left hand side and press **Create Project**
![pages](./screencaps/pages-create-project.png)

Select **Connect to Git**

![pages](./screencaps/pages-connect-git.png)

Make sure you are on the GitHub Tab and press **Connect to GitHub**

![pages](./screencaps/pages-connect-github.png)

```{admonition} Authenticate to GitHub
:class: note
If you are not already logged into GitHub in your browser you may be asked to re-authenticate
```
You will be prompted to **Install and Authorize** Cloudflare Pages to your github account, press the button to proceed.

![linkgh](./screencaps/pages_gh_auth.png)

Once connected you will be brought back to the Cloudflare Pages dashboard. 


```{admonition} Re-Select Connect to Git
:class: note
In certain cases you will be brought back to the Project Page where you have to select **Connect to Git** again - if so just press it and then it will bring you into the selection of a repository
```


Select *connect_2022_lab3* on the following page 

![linkgh](./screencaps/pages_gh_repo_select.png)

Once selected you will need to configure build parameters. This is build using React so we will set the following build parameters:
```
Project name - connect_2022_lab3
Production branch - master
Framework preset - *blank*
Build command - *blank*
Build output directory - /public
```

![linkgh](./screencaps/lab3pages-deploy.png)


Press **Save & Deploy**

```{admonition} Deployment Progress
:class: note
Once started the deployment will take a few moments to complete - you can follow the deployment details to monitor progress of the deployment.
```
Once the deployment has completed you will be presented with a success message as well as a URL to visit your new project Select the **link**.

```{admonition} URL Link
:class: warning
The URL will be at the top of the page, you may have to scroll up to see it
```

![linkgh](./screencaps/pages-success.png)

```{admonition} pages.dev Domain
:class: note
By default new projects will automatically be given a *.pages.dev domain, If you would like to setup custom routes to your own domain you can do that through DNS CNAMEing (or directly in the project settings if your domain nameservers are Cloudflare)
```

A page should launch with the simple words *Hello World!*

Great this means our application is up and now we can write a simple A/B Test to populate an image onto the page.


## Write A/B Testing Function ##

With the application running lets return to our terminal and navigate to the *functions* directory

``` sh
cd functions
```

Here there is a file *_middleware.ts* this file is the Workers function that will execute on every request to the `/` or `root` page. 

Open the *_middleware.ts* file in your favorite text editor.
```{admonition} Text Editor
:class: note
VS Code is a versatile text editor that can be launched directly from the terminal using *code <filename>* to install VS Code follow the steps found in the [Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
```


We will now add the function to this file that will follow the following logic:

1. Collect the origin response for the page (in this case since we placed the *_middleware.ts* file into the root it will be the root HTML page)
2. Choose between two images at random (the `Math.random()` produces a value between 1 & 0 and testing it against a limit of 0.5 means an almost 50/50 split)
3. Re-Write the HTML respone with the new image in the body and deliver it to the requestor.

The enter the below code into the *_middleware.ts* file
``` js
const imageA =
  "https://imagedelivery.net/Upv7Q0MhroCOJHZCX_pZgA/9b0fabf0-8a5d-4d84-29d7-c438eb002d00/public";
const imageB =
  "https://imagedelivery.net/Upv7Q0MhroCOJHZCX_pZgA/2b143d0b-006a-47e7-db0e-ce523edf5300/public";

export const onRequest: PagesFunction = async ({ env, request }) => {
  const response = await env.ASSETS.fetch(request);

  const imageURL = Math.random() > 0.5 ? imageA : imageB;

  return new HTMLRewriter()
    .on("body", {
      element(body) {
        body.append(`<img src="${imageURL}" />`, { html: true });
      },
    })
    .transform(response);
    
};
```

```{admonition} Choosing Images
:class: note
You can see in the code we are choosing between two images - these are hosted on Cloudflare Images. If you wanted to select any other images you could just paste the image URL there in the `imageA` or `imageB` variable definitions.
```

Save the file once you are done editing it.

## Testing the Code Locally before Deploying ##

In order to test if our code has worked we could very easily publish our changes to the GitHub repository and have it changed live - but that doesn't make sense in development environments because you may want to debug and validate your code works as expected before pushing it. To do this we have updated Wrangler to allow for local simulation of projects. Lets launch a local development instance of our project.

Back in the terminal window make sure the latest wrangler beta is installed

``` sh
npm install wrangler@latest
```
```{admonition} npm installation
:class: note
if you have not already installed npm on your system follow the steps in the Pre-Requisite section [here](./npm.md)
```

With the latest wrangler installed you can launch the project locally, first lets go back to the root project directory and then launch wrangler

``` sh
cd ..
npx wrangler pages dev ./public
```
As the project is launching you should see
``` sh 
> npx wrangler pages dev ./public
ðŸš§ 'wrangler pages <command>' is a beta command. Please report any issues to https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/new/choose
Compiling worker to "/var/folders/5x/85cqyfb17tjbx6sxvdgpsk8h0000gp/T/functionsWorker.js"...
Compiled Worker successfully.
Serving at http://localhost:8788/
```

And on completion it should automatically launch a browser bringing you to your new homepage, with one of the pictures you selected! 

![working-function](./screencaps/workingfunction.png)



If you refresh the page slowly a few times you should see the image cycle in-between the two images set in the worker script, this is the `HTMLRewriter` in action!

If you look back at the terminal window you will also notice the HTTP Requests being logged in the console by wrangler - when needed this is helpful when troubleshooting.

``` sh
GET / 200 OK (52.79ms)
GET /favicon.ico 200 OK (5.60ms)
GET / 200 OK (4.17ms)
GET /favicon.ico 200 OK (3.78ms)
GET / 200 OK (4.12ms)
GET /favicon.ico 200 OK (4.16ms)
```


Now that we have confirmed the A/B test works as expected we can kill the wrangler dev setup with `cntrl+c` and push our changes to github.

``` sh
git add .
git commit -m "added A/B test to randomly serve image"
git push
```

If we return to the the Cloudflare Pages project we should see that the deployment is in progress - wait for it to complete.

Once complete we can navigate to our application URL but this time we should a new images on our homepage! If we refresh slowly again we should see the image cycle just like we did in testing! 

```{admonition} Image not changing? 
:class: warning
Try loading the page in an incognito window in certain cases this helps with issues where browser is locally caching web elements.
```


```{admonition} LAB 3 COMPLETE! 
:class: note
You have successfully Completed Lab 3 - Cloudflare Workers, you have used the `HTMLRewriter` function to manipulate web content and deliver different content to different users based on a random seed. You ran your web application locally with wrangler to help test changes before deploying them live!
